- Apache Kafka 2.2.0 downloaded and extracted (please refer to https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)



## Instructions



### Starting Kafka

Open a new terminal window, change to the Kafka directory `kafka_2.12-2.2.0`.

Example:

```bash
cd $HOME/kafka_2.12-2.2.0
```

If using Linux, start ZooKeeper this way:

```bash
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

If using Windows, start ZooKeeper this way:

```bash
bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
```

Wait for the log message to continue:

```
INFO binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181
```

Open a new terminal window, change to the Kafka directory `kafka_2.12-2.2.0`.

If using Linux, start Kafka this way:

```
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

If using Windows, start Kafka this way:

```
bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties
```

Wait for the log message to continue:

```
INFO [KafkaServer id=0] started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)
```

Open a new terminal window, change to the Kafka directory `kafka_2.12-2.2.0`.

If using Linux, create the topic `issue-event-topic` this way:

```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1 --topic issue-event-topic
```

If using Windows, create the topic `issue-event-topic` this way:

```
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1 --topic issue-event-topic
```

Wait for the return of the prompt to continue.

### Starting the microservices

Open a new terminal window, change to a working directory and clone the code from GitHub as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helderlee/octo-events.git
```

Enter to the octo-events directory:

```bash
cd octo-events
```

#### Starting the subscriber service

Enter to the octo-subscriber directory.

```bash
cd octo-subscriber
```

Build the octo-subscriber subproject:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

The tests will be executed. After that, run the octo-subscriber subproject:

```bash
gradle bootRun
```

Wait for the log message to continue:

```
Setting newly assigned partitions
```

At the first time, the log message below may appear after the log message above and you can continue:

```
Resetting offset for partition
```



#### Starting the producer service

Let octo-subscriber running and open a new terminal window. Change to the octo-events directory again. Enter to the octo-producer directory:

```bash
cd octo-producer
```

Build the octo-producer subproject:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

The tests will be executed. After that, run the octo-producer subproject:

```bash
gradle run
```

Wait for the log message to continue:

```
INFO  io.javalin.Javalin - Javalin has started \o/
```



#### Starting the query service

Let octo-subscriber running and open a new terminal window. Change to the octo-events directory again. Enter to the octo-query directory.

```bash
cd octo-query
```

Build the octo-query subproject:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

The tests will be executed. After that, run the octo-query subproject:

```bash
gradle run
```

Wait for the log message to continue:

```
INFO  io.javalin.Javalin - Javalin has started \o/
```



### Routing to localhost

Open a new terminal window, change to the ngrok directory. Expose the octo-producer publicly with ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Copy the http forwarding URL generated by ngrok and enter any GitHub repository you own.

Click on *Settings* tab and then on *Webhooks* option in the menu.

Click on '*Add Webhook*' button. Enter your password if asked.

On '*Payload URL*' field, paste the http forwarding URL generated by ngrok and add */issues/events* to the URL:

```bash
http://********.ngrok.io/issues/events
```

Select '*application/json*' on field '*Content type*'.

On field '*Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?*', select '*Let me select individual events.*' option.

Uncheck the '*Pushes*' option.

Check the '*Issues*' option.

Make sure only '*Issues*' option is selected and click on '*Add webhook*' button.

The browser will return to the '*Webhooks*' page and the icon will turn into a red triangle with an exclamation point inside of it. If you roll the mouse over the red triangle icon, you will see the message:

```
Last delivery was not successful. Invalid HTTP Response: 406.
```

It is totally fine because the first generated event was not an issue event and the message was rejected by the producer service as you can see at the producer terminal window with a log message:

```
ERROR d.h.o.p.handler.ProducerHandler - #: 2 schema violations found
```

To generate a correct issue event, click on '*Issues*' tab and click on '*New issue*' button.

Type any title and any comment and click '*Submit new issue*' button.

Write down the issue number which is indicated with a # symbol.

Check the log on the ngrok terminal window.

Check the log on the octo-producer terminal window.

Check the log on the octo-subscriber terminal window.

Open a browser window and enter the following URL with the generated issue number:

```bash
http://localhost:8787/issues/<generated issue number>/events
```

Example:

```bash
http://localhost:8787/issues/1/events
```



It was fun!!!
